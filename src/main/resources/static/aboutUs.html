          <h2>Landon Sims</h2>
          <img src="/images/Landon-Headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot" />
          <p>
            Interested in multiple topics including mathematics, neuroscience,
            and quantitative trading. After participating in the Ohio State
            University Marching band as a snare player in I-Row and pursuing a
            career in discretionary trading it has led me to pursuing software
            development. As a fun side project I am currently re-working some
            open source code I found that uses computer vision to predict the
            outcome of roulette. This is a stepping stone into some more
            quantitative trading ideas, following the path of Edward O. Thorp.
            Currently, living on the road.

            I am a musician and play in a band with my wife. Together we
            started, and are directors of, a non-profit called Mission Love. I
            am a creative problem solver who likes to think outside the box.
            Aside from music I enjoy creating things out of wood and metal. My
            greatest joy in life are my two sons who are the center of my world.
